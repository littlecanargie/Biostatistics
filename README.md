# Calculus

- This repository contains latex codes for the materials used in my course *Biostatistics* at National Dong Hwa University, Taiwan.  (Ongoing developement!)

- The course is intended for senior undergraduates with some exposure to mathematical statistics and linear models.  In this course, I intend to introduce the theorectical *and* applied aspects of three common analysis approaches in biostatistics and epidemiology:
  - Generalized linear models
  - Survival analysis
  - Causal inference

- The applied part of this course is carried out with R.  Therefore, the tex files are to be compiled in environments with *knitr* and *R* set up.
